## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Warehouse staff receive hundreds of randomly-ordered packing slips and shipping labels each day. They spend 2+ hours manually:
- Reading each packing slip to identify products
- Looking up warehouse locations for each product  
- Physically sorting documents by warehouse area
- Matching packing slips to their corresponding shipping labels
- Walking inefficient routes through the warehouse

**After**: Upload two PDFs → Get perfectly organized documents in 2 minutes, ready for efficient warehouse picking.

## ⚡ Business Impact

- ⏱️ **95% Time Reduction**: 2 hours → 2 minutes daily
- 🎯 **Zero Sorting Errors**: Eliminates manual mistakes
- 📈 **Efficiency Gains**: Optimized warehouse picking routes
- 🔄 **Infinite Scalability**: Handles any volume of orders
- 👥 **User-Friendly**: Designed for non-technical warehouse staff

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 **Intelligent Document Processing**
- **Extracts product information** from packing slip PDFs using advanced text analysis
- **Maps products to warehouse locations** using a customizable CSV database
- **Handles special cases** like sample products (auto-assigned to "garage" area)
- **Validates and cross-references** packing slips with shipping labels

### 📊 **Smart Multi-Level Sorting**
- **Primary sort**: By warehouse area (A13 → D16 → B11 → B12 → etc.)
- **Secondary sort**: By product name within each area (alphabetical grouping)
- **Result**: All identical products grouped together for maximum picking efficiency

### 📄 **Automated Report Generation**
- **Creates summary pages** showing exactly what's in each warehouse area
- **Groups by product and size** with quantity totals
- **Follows warehouse area priority order** for optimal picking routes
- **Professional PDF formatting** with tables and clear organization

### 🖨️ **Advanced Print Management**
- **Multi-printer support** (Brother for packing slips, DYMO for labels)
- **Print order optimization** prevents pages coming out in reverse
- **Automatic printer detection** and configuration
- **User choice**: Print immediately or review first

### 🗂️ **Warehouse Map Management**
- **Built-in editor** for managing product-to-location mappings
- **Search and filter** products and locations in real-time
- **Duplicate detection** and automatic cleanup tools
- **Alphabetical sorting** for easy navigation

## 📋 Sample Workflow

**Input**: 50 random packing slips for various products across the warehouse

**Output**: Perfectly organized like this:
```
📋 Summary Pages (what's in each area)
🏢 Locker A13: College Loafer Black (2), College Loafer Brown (1)
🏢 Locker B11: Boomer Tan (3), Cosima Sandal Black (1)  
🏢 Locker B12: Athena Black (2), Buddy Ivory (1), Caye Slide (3)
🏠 Garage: Sample Products (5)

📄 Individual packing slips and labels sorted to match summary
```

Warehouse staff can now pick efficiently: grab all College Loafers from A13, all Boomers from B11, etc.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Python 3.8+** - Core application logic
- **PySimpleGUI** - Cross-platform GUI framework  
- **pypdf** - PDF manipulation and merging
- **ReportLab** - Professional PDF generation
- **pdfplumber** - Advanced text extraction from PDFs
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and CSV handling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Python 3.8 or later
- Administrative privileges for printer setup

### Installation

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Download from python.org or use Homebrew
   brew install python3
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install PySimpleGUI pandas pypdf reportlab pdfplumber
   ```

3. **Set Up Application**:
   ```bash
   # Create application directory
   sudo mkdir -p /Applications/Packingslipapp/assets
   
   # Copy application files
   sudo cp app6.py /Applications/Packingslipapp/
   sudo cp assets/warehouse_map.csv /Applications/Packingslipapp/assets/
   
   # Set permissions
   sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff /Applications/Packingslipapp
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd /Applications/Packingslipapp
   python3 app6.py
   ```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Operation
1. **Select Input Files**: Choose your packing slips and shipping labels PDFs
2. **Choose Output Directory**: Select where to save organized files  
3. **Click Process**: Watch the magic happen in seconds
4. **Review Results**: Check the organized PDFs before printing
5. **Print (Optional)**: Send to configured printers with one click

### Warehouse Map Management
- Click **"Update Warehouse Map"** to open the product database editor
- **Search products** or **filter by locker** for quick updates
- **Add new products** as your inventory grows
- **Remove duplicates** with the built-in cleanup tool

### Sample Products
- Products containing "sample" in the name are automatically sorted to "Garage"
- No need to add samples to the warehouse map - they're handled automatically
- Perfect for one-off sample orders that don't follow normal warehouse organization

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Warehouse Areas
Modify the sorting order by updating `AREA_SORT_ORDER` in the code:
```python
AREA_SORT_ORDER = ['A13', 'D16', 'B11', 'B12', 'B13', 'B14', 'B16', 'B17', 'B18', 'B19', 'garage']
```

### Printer Setup
Update printer names to match your hardware:
```python
# In the print configuration section
printer_name="YOUR_PACKING_SLIP_PRINTER"  # e.g., "Brother_MFC_J4535DW"
printer_name="YOUR_LABEL_PRINTER"         # e.g., "DYMO_LabelWriter_4XL"
```

### Warehouse Map Format
The CSV file should follow this structure:
```csv
Product Name,Area
Athena Black Patent,B12
Boomer Tan,B11
College Loafer Black,B13
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: Reinstall packages with `pip3 install --upgrade [package_name]`

**Permission Errors**: Fix with `sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff /Applications/Packingslipapp`

**Printer Issues**: 
- Check available printers: `lpstat -p`
- Verify printer connectivity and drivers
- Update printer names in configuration

**PDF Processing Errors**:
- Ensure PDFs are not password-protected
- Check for sufficient disk space
- Verify PDF files are not corrupted

### Debug Information
Check the log file `packing_slip_organizer.log` in the application directory for detailed troubleshooting information.
